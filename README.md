# Overview


# Deliverable 1 

I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.

# Deliverable 2 - Update the Web App with Mars’s Hemisphere Images and Titles

I used Python and HTML skills to add the code from Deliverable 1 to my scraping.py file, I updated my Mongo database, and modified my index.html file so the webpage contains all the information collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.

# Deliverable 3 - Add Bootstrap 3 Components

I used the Bootstrap 3 grid system examples to update my index.html file so my website is mobile-responsive.

I added two other Bootstrap 3 components to customize certain aspects of the webpage.

# Results

I scraped full resolution images of Mar's hemispheres and titles of those images.
I updated the scrapying.py file with code from Deliverable 1, updated the Mongo database, and modified the index.html file.
I then added Bootstrap 3 components to be mobile responsive and to customize the webpage.


# Summary
BeautifulSoup can customize websites so they are mobile responsive and that they capture the eye of the user.  I learned how to scrape data from a website.
